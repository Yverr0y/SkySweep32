# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Runtime Thresholds Now Effective**: `CountermeasureSystem::assessThreat()` read the compile-time `RSSI_THRESHOLD_*` macros instead of the values in `ConfigManager`, so the `/api/calibrate` and `/api/config` endpoints saved new thresholds that never influenced threat detection. Threat assessment now uses the live runtime config.
- **Broken Flash Instructions**: The "Start from Zero" guides (EN/RU) told users to flash `SkySweep32_Starter_v0.5.0.bin`, which does not exist in `releases/`. Corrected to the shipped `v0.5.1` binary.
- **Version Drift**: Unified the firmware version reported in serial/web (`SKYSWEEP_VERSION`) and `TODO.md` to `0.6.0` to match the changelog.
- **CC1101 `receiveData` OOB**: Returned the raw on-air length byte (up to 255) while only copying `maxLength` bytes, so callers read past their 64-byte buffer. It now returns the number of bytes actually copied.
- **CC1101 band/spectrum scans** left the radio tuned to the last-scanned frequency; they now save and restore the real pre-scan frequency.
- **CC1101 `writeRegister`** had an unbounded busy-wait on a hardcoded pin; it now waits on `PIN_SPI_MISO` with a 10 ms timeout so an absent/faulty chip can't hang the task.
- **MAVLink length truncation**: `expectedLength` was `uint8_t`, so payloads of 248–255 bytes wrapped and parsed garbage; widened to `uint16_t`. `parseHeartbeat()` now zero-initializes its result on short payloads.
- **Signal DB scoring**: partial RSSI-match distance was `int8_t` and could overflow (0–100 scale vs negative-dBm bounds), corrupting the score; widened to `int`.
- **Deep-sleep duration**: `sleepDurationUs` was `uint32_t`, truncating sleeps over ~71 minutes; widened to `uint64_t`.
- **GPS geofence name**: `strncpy` could leave the name non-NUL-terminated; now explicitly terminated.
- **Cosmetic/log**: NRF24 spectrum log printed MHz as "GHz"; Meshtastic triangulation log passed `size_t` to `%d`; corrected `power_manager` comments (GPIO36/ADC1_CH0, 12 dB attenuation).
- **cppcheck warnings**: `data_logger` logged a `uint32_t` timestamp with `%lu` (type mismatch); fully initialized the ATAK, CRSF, MAVLink, and Acoustic constructors; gave `GPSModule` deleted copy operations (it owns a raw `HardwareSerial*`).

### Security
- **CRSF parser buffer overflow (critical)**: an attacker-controlled length byte of `0xFE`/`0xFF` wrapped `uint8_t expectedLength` to 0/1, then `memcpy`'d up to ~252 bytes into the 60-byte payload buffer. The length is now range-validated and `expectedLength` widened; the CRC is also read at the correct in-frame offset.
- **Remote ID BLE OOB read**: the BLE Remote ID parsers read fixed offsets (up to byte 22) from variable-length, attacker-controlled service data after only a `length < 2` check. Added per-message-type minimum-length guards.
- **ESP-NOW OOB read**: the receive callback only checked `len >= 4` before dereferencing union payloads at offset 8+. It now validates the full header plus the per-type payload length before handling.
- **Web `/api/logs/download` path traversal**: the `file` parameter was concatenated into a path with no validation; now rejects `..`, path separators, and CR/LF.
- **Web OTA false success**: the endpoint reported success and rebooted even when no firmware was written (`Update.hasError()` is false in that case too); success is now tracked from the upload and gated on a verified write.
- **Web `/api/config` POST**: wrote one byte past the framework buffer (`data[len]=0`) and only handled single-chunk bodies; now accumulates chunks into a bounded `String`.
- **WebSocket handler**: removed a similar one-past-end write; the message is now printed length-bounded.

### Changed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Pinned the PlatformIO platform to `espressif32 @ ^6.9.0`. This firmware depends on IDF 4.4 APIs (legacy `driver/adc.h`, `esp_task_wdt_init(timeout, panic)`) that changed in `espressif32` 7.x, so the pin prevents an accidental incompatible-major upgrade.
- **Simpler RF Task Loops**: Replaced the repeated `#ifndef MODULE_*` guard blocks in the RF-scan and display tasks with a single `rfModuleEnabled()` helper (behavior unchanged).
- **Portable hardware generators (large refactor)**: `build_kicad.py`, `render_pcb.py` and `enclosures/build_case.py` no longer hardcode a single Windows output path — each derives its output from the script location and accepts CLI overrides.
  - `build_kicad.py`: split into `build_pcb()` / `main()` with `argparse`, shared S-expression emit-helpers (`fp_ref`/`fp_val`/`fp_rect`/…) collapsing the per-footprint boilerplate, a `NET` name→index lookup, and dead code removed. Output is **byte-identical** to before (verified by a UUID/date-normalized diff).
  - `render_pcb.py`: restructured from a flat script into `draw()`/`render()`/`main()` with the axes passed explicitly; dropped unused imports and dead math; fixed the matplotlib `color`/`edgecolor` warnings.
  - `enclosures/build_case.py`: now **headless-capable** — STL export works via `freecadcmd` without a GUI (all `ViewObject`/render calls are guarded on `FreeCAD.GuiUp`); dimensions hoisted to named constants; dead code (`sma_h`, stray `sys.exit`) removed.

### Added
- **CI Coverage for Optional Modules**: New `esp32dev_full` PlatformIO env plus a CI step compiles the ATAK / Compass / Acoustic / GPS code paths that no release tier enables, so they no longer rot undetected.
- **CI Maintenance**: Bumped GitHub Actions (`checkout@v4`, `setup-python@v5`, `cache@v4`, `action-gh-release@v2`) and added a `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual runs.
- **Build Status Badge**: Added the GitHub Actions CI badge to the README.
- **Host Unit Tests for Parsers**: Added `test/host/` — desktop-compiled tests (system `g++`, no ESP32 toolchain/PlatformIO registry) that build the CRSF/MAVLink parsers against a minimal `Arduino.h` stub with AddressSanitizer/UBSan. They lock in the buffer-safety fixes (hostile length bytes rejected, valid frames round-trip), the CRSF RC-channel pack/unpack round-trip, the GPS/heartbeat `parse*` bounds guards, and a deterministic ~460k-frame fuzz pass over both parsers; run in CI via a new `host-tests.yml` workflow.
- **Static Analysis (cppcheck)**: the host workflow (renamed *Host Tests & Static Analysis*) now also runs cppcheck warning-level checks over the full feature set — a system tool, so it needs no PlatformIO registry and gates on likely defects.

### Documentation
- Refreshed the README software-architecture tree (EN + RU) to list every current module (it previously showed only 4 of ~20) and added a **Testing** section.
- Documented the `/api/calibrate` endpoint in the EN + RU API references (it was implemented but undocumented).
- Added a "Running tests locally" guide (host tests + cppcheck) to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **GitHub Pages**: added a *Hardened & Field-Tested* capability card (EN + RU) reflecting the parser hardening, fuzzing and CI static analysis.
- Added `hardware/README.md` (index + how to regenerate the PCB/preview) and updated the enclosure regeneration guide for the portable, headless scripts.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **ATAK Integration (Cursor on Target)**: Added `#ifdef MODULE_ATAK`. Sends CoT UDP packets for drone targets directly to Android Team Awareness Kit on port 6969.

- **TinyML AI Classification**: Replaced rule-based engine with TensorFlow Lite Micro via `EloquentTinyML` (`#ifdef MODULE_ML`). Predicts drone class based on RSSI variance and multi-band spectral data tensor.
- **Optional Feature Flags**: Added `-DMODULE_COMPASS`, `-DMODULE_ML`, and `-DMODULE_ATAK` to `platformio.ini` to keep base footprint small.
