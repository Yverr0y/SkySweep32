# Host unit tests

Desktop-compiled unit tests for the pure-logic protocol parsers
(`src/protocols/crsf_parser.cpp`, `src/protocols/mavlink_parser.cpp`).

These parsers decode **attacker-controlled RF input**, so they are the highest-value
code to test for memory safety. They depend only on fixed-width integer types and
`memcpy`/`memset`, so they build against the tiny [`Arduino.h`](Arduino.h) stub in
this directory with any desktop compiler — **no ESP32 toolchain or PlatformIO
registry required**.

## Run

```bash
make -C test/host
```

This compiles the real parser sources with **AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer**
and runs the suite. Any out-of-bounds read/write on a malformed frame aborts the
process, so the "malicious frame" cases double as overflow regression guards.

Coverage includes:

- CRSF: hostile length bytes (`0xFE`/`0xFF`) and over-max payloads are rejected
  without overflowing the 60-byte payload buffer; a valid built frame round-trips
  (verifying the CRC-offset and frame-length fixes).
- MAVLink: a valid heartbeat round-trips; a 250-byte-payload frame validates
  (verifying the widened `expectedLength`); a truncated frame is not accepted;
  `parseHeartbeat` zero-initializes on short payloads.

CI runs the same command via [`.github/workflows/host-tests.yml`](../../.github/workflows/host-tests.yml).
